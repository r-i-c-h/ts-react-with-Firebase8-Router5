# CRUD App

## Tech Used
* Vite
* TypeScript
* React
* React Router (v5)
* SASS/SCSS
* Google Firebase Firestore Database v8.5

## Future Revision Ides:
* Complete Mobile Responsive Layout ðŸŽ¨
* Add a real full-text ðŸ”Žsearch because **Firebase DOESN'T DO THAT?!?!?**
  * Current search solution mirrors that of the Home `.get()` and parses the entirety of **every** record/doc in the collection - this obviously _will not scale_
  * Search Solutions Ideas
    * Google literally suggest using a 3rd party ala Algolia/Elastisearch[presumably on AWS] \(aka, spend moneyðŸ’°ðŸ’¸);
    * Tokenize each word to a number value and combine `.where()` clauses

    * SubIndex every possible permutation of the title

    * An odd idea relating to charCodes that probably doesn't work
